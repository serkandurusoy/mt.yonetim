# Mitolojix Backend Application

First, you should check out the repositories:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/Workspaces/projects/mitolojix && cd ~/Workspaces/projects/mitolojix/
$ git clone https://github.com/mitolojix/yonetim.git
$ git clone https://github.com/mitolojix/oyun.git
```

For deployment environments, read the following and use the nginx config file provided in the .config folder of yonetim
